# CI/CD Practice

This automation framework was taken from [Original Framework](https://github.com/carlos-sandoval-c/POM-Practice). It is built with `Java 8`, `Selenium`, `TestNG` and for this project `Allure` was added to generate reports of the results.

The reports can be consulted through this [Report Page](https://carlos-sandoval-c.github.io/CI-CD-Practice/).
